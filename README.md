## Structure

The project is seperated in multiple modules, all serve single or multiple uses depending on their importance.

| Module         | Description                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Copyboard`    | Contains all the UI-related elements, including Settings, setting up the menubar, and initializing the monitors.                 |
| `ClipKit`      | Handles all the storage management, monitoring, pausing, contains default ignored content along with handling the app blacklist. |
| `DataTypesKit` | Provides a large list of supported clipboard data types, used by Copyboard to filter and display the proper content to the user. |
| `MenuBarKit`   | Manages the menubar and displays the content window, with support for features like right-click actions and custom behavior.     |

## Types

Some clipboard items are always ignored by default to protect your privacy. Documented on [nspasteboard.org](https://nspasteboard.org/), certain types especially custom or app specific ones can contain sensitive information and should not be stored. By default, we automatically skip these types. We also always ignore some specific types related to Apple's remote clipboard and Copyboard itself.

Always Ignored Types:

  - `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier!`
  - `com.apple.is-remote-clipboard`

Apps Types:

  - `org.p0deje.Maccy`
  - `com.agilebits.onepassword`
  - `net.antelle.keeweb`

Transient Types:

  - `org.nspasteboard.TransientType`
  - `de.petermaurer.TransientPasteboardType`
  - `com.typeit4me.clipping`
  - `org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType`

Concealed Types:

  - `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`

If you maintain your own clipboard manager and want to ignore copies from Copyboard, you can put `thewonderofyou.Copyboard` in your type blacklist. This should avoid overlap.
